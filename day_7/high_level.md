# How I would solve the CeasarCipher

1. create a variable "Cipher Text"
1. Create a hash with our Alphabet and desired key. This is +3
2. Use an iteration method that will replace each character of the string.
  - This will likley require using the split method to seperate each character so it can be iterated individually
  - Then replace the instance with the ciphered letter (check hash)
